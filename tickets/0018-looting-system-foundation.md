# Looting System Foundation Implementation

## Description

Implement the foundation for a battle royale looting system that allows players to find, manage, and use weapons, ammo, and items distributed throughout the map.

## Objectives

- Create basic item and weapon spawning system across the map
- Implement item pickup and interaction mechanics
- Add inventory management system for collected items
- Create weapon switching and ammunition tracking
- Implement item rarity tiers for varied gameplay

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Item Spawning System**

   - Create item spawn point data structure throughout the map
   - Implement weighted loot table system with rarity tiers
   - Add randomized item distribution algorithm
   - Create item state synchronization
   - Implement item despawn and respawn logic (if applicable)

2. **Item Interaction**

   - Implement item pickup detection and validation
   - Create item ownership transfer system
   - Add item usage logic (consumables, etc.)
   - Implement dropped item handling
   - Create item interaction permissions and limitations

3. **Inventory Management**

   - Implement player inventory data structure
   - Create capacity and slot limitations
   - Add item stacking and quantity tracking
   - Implement weapon and ammo relationship tracking
   - Create inventory synchronization system

4. **Loot Balance**
   - Implement loot density configuration for map regions
   - Create high-value loot zones with increased risk
   - Add dynamic loot adjustment based on player count
   - Implement rare item placement strategy
   - Create loot respawn system (if applicable)

### Client

1. **Item Visualization**

   - Implement item models and visual effects
   - Create item state visualization (available, owned, used)
   - Add rarity visual indicators
   - Implement item highlight and interaction prompts
   - Create pickup animations and effects

2. **Inventory UI**

   - Implement inventory display interface
   - Create drag-and-drop item management
   - Add equipment slots visualization
   - Implement quick-access slots and hotkeys
   - Create item comparison and information display

3. **Interaction System**
   - Implement item pickup controls and feedback
   - Create interaction radius and targeting system
   - Add item usage controls and animations
   - Implement weapon switching UI and controls
   - Create context-sensitive interaction options

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Items spawn consistently across the map with appropriate rarity distribution
- [ ] Players can easily identify, approach, and pick up items
- [ ] Inventory management feels intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Weapon switching and ammo management works reliably
- [ ] Item rarity system creates meaningful progression during a match
- [ ] System handles edge cases like item dropping, stacking, and capacity limits
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal even with many items in an area

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Map design completion
- Player movement system
- Combat system
- UI framework
