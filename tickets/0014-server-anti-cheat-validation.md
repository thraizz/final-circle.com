# Basic Anti-Cheat Validation Implementation

## Description

Implement foundational anti-cheat measures to ensure fair gameplay by detecting and preventing common cheating methods.

## Objectives

- Add basic movement validation to detect speed hacking
- Implement shot validation to prevent impossible shots

- [ ] Impossible shots are rejected by the server
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents automation of player actions
- [ ] Input validation catches and rejects invalid game commands
- [ ] Server maintains authority over all critical game mechanics
- [ ] Logging system captures suspicious activities
- [ ] System does not impact performance for legitimate players

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Player movement implementation
- Combat system implementation
- Server-side game state management
