# Basic Anti-Cheat Validation Implementation

## Description

Implement foundational anti-cheat measures to ensure fair gameplay by detecting and preventing common cheating methods.

## Objectives

- Add basic movement validation to detect speed hacking
- Implement shot validation to prevent impossible shots
- Create rate limiting for actions to prevent automation/macros
- Add basic input validation for all game actions
- Implement server authority for critical game mechanics

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Movement Validation**

   - Implement physics-based movement constraints
   - Create server-side movement speed checks
   - Add position reconciliation for invalid movements
   - Implement server authority for player positions

2. **Combat Validation**

   - Create line of sight validation for shots
   - Implement rate-of-fire validation
   - Add damage output validation
   - Create hit validation based on projectile physics

3. **Action Rate Limiting**

   - Implement action cooldowns and rate limiting
   - Create server-side validation for action timing
   - Add abnormal behavior detection for repeated actions
   - Implement automated timeout system for detected violations

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Create detailed logging for suspicious activities
   - Implement basic statistical analysis for player actions
   - Add admin notification system for potential cheating
   - Create basic replay capability for suspicious actions

### Client

1. **Client Integrity**
   - Implement basic tamper detection for client code
   - Create checksums for critical client files
   - Add basic client-side validation to prevent obvious cheating

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Speed hacking is detected and prevented
- [ ] Impossible shots are rejected by the server
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents automation of player actions
- [ ] Input validation catches and rejects invalid game commands
- [ ] Server maintains authority over all critical game mechanics
- [ ] Logging system captures suspicious activities
- [ ] System does not impact performance for legitimate players

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Player movement implementation
- Combat system implementation
- Server-side game state management
