# Damage Falloff System Implementation

## Description

Implement a distance-based damage falloff system to create balanced weapon mechanics where effectiveness decreases over distance in a realistic and gameplay-appropriate manner.

## Objectives

- Create weapon-specific damage falloff curves
- Implement distance calculation for damage modification
- Add visual feedback for damage falloff
- Create testing tools for damage falloff tuning
- Implement damage reduction based on penetration through objects

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Damage Model**

   - Design data structure for weapon damage profiles
   - Implement distance-based damage calculation
   - Create curve-based falloff system with configurable parameters
   - Add minimum/maximum damage thresholds
   - Implement material penetration modifiers

2. **Calculation Logic**

   - Create efficient distance calculation system
   - Implement damage falloff formulas with weapon type consideration
   - Add trajectory tracking for accurate distance measurement
   - Create performance-optimized calculation system
   - Implement server-side validation for damage values

3. **Configuration System**
   - Create weapon damage profile configuration
   - Implement falloff curve parameters
   - Add testing and visualization tools for developers
   - Create documentation for damage falloff tuning

### Client

1. **Visual Feedback**

   - Implement damage number indicators reflecting falloff (optional)
   - Create hit marker intensity based on damage
   - Add subtle visual cues for effective range
   - Implement weapon feedback reflecting damage effectiveness

2. **Testing Tools**
   - Create damage falloff visualization in test environment
   - Implement damage indicator display for testing
   - Add distance measurement tool for testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Weapons deal appropriate damage based on distance
- [ ] Damage falloff feels natural and gameplay-appropriate
- [ ] Different weapon types have distinct effective ranges
- [ ] Visual feedback clearly communicates damage effectiveness
- [ ] System is easy to tune and balance for each weapon
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal during intensive combat
- [ ] Penetration through objects correctly reduces damage

## Priority

Medium (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Combat system implementation
- Hitbox-based hit detection
- Weapon system implementation
