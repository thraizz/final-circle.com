# Damage Falloff System Implementation

## Description

Implement a distance-based damage falloff system to create balanced weapon mechanics where effectiveness decreases over distance in a realistic and gameplay-appropriate manner.

## Objectives

- Create weapon-specific damage falloff curves
- Implement distance calculation for damage modification
- Add visual feedback for damage falloff
- Create testing tools for damage falloff tuning
- Implement damage reduction based on penetration through objects

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Weapons deal appropriate damage based on distance
- [ ] Damage falloff feels natural and gameplay-appropriate
- [ ] Different weapon types have distinct effective ranges
- [ ] Visual feedback clearly communicates damage effectiveness
- [ ] System is easy to tune and balance for each weapon
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal during intensive combat
- [ ] Penetration through objects correctly reduces damage

## Priority

Medium (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Combat system implementation
- Hitbox-based hit detection
- Weapon system implementation
