# Initial Battle Royale Map Design

## Description

Design and implement the first battle royale map with balanced terrain, strategic cover points, and clear landmarks while maintaining optimal performance.

## Map Layout and Strategic Elements

### Major Landmarks and POIs

1. **Central Hub - "The Nexus"**

   - Elevated circular platform with multiple entry points
   - Underground tunnel system connecting to major routes
   - High-tier loot but extremely exposed position
   - Clear sight lines in all directions

2. **Mountain Ranges**

   - "Northern Peaks" - Tallest mountain chain with sniper positions
   - "Eastern Ridge" - More accessible, terraced mountain with mining facilities
   - "Western Cliffs" - Sheer cliff faces with rope bridge connections

3. **Water Features**
   - "Serpentine River" - Main waterway splitting the map diagonally
   - "Delta Junction" - Where the river splits into three branches
   - "Crystal Lake" - Large body of water with small islands and bridges
   - Underwater passages connecting key locations

### Towns and Settlements

1. **"Industrial District"**

   - Factory complexes with vertical gameplay
   - Storage yards with containers for cover
   - Underground maintenance tunnels
   - High-density loot area

2. **"Research Facility"**

   - Modern buildings with lots of windows
   - Rooftop helicopter pads
   - Underground labs
   - Medium to high-tier loot

3. **"Old Town"**

   - Dense cluster of traditional buildings
   - Narrow alleyways and courtyards
   - Bell tower as a central landmark
   - Mixed-tier loot distribution

4. **"Harbor Point"**
   - Shipping containers and cranes
   - Warehouse districts
   - Partially submerged ships
   - Water-based combat opportunities

### Strategic Zones

1. **"The Arena"**

   - Natural bowl formation
   - Multiple elevation levels
   - Good for final circle scenarios
   - Limited cover but excellent sight lines

2. **"Forest Maze"**

   - Dense vegetation for stealth
   - Tree houses and zip lines
   - Natural cover and ambush points
   - Low to medium-tier loot

3. **"Bunker Network"**
   - Connected underground facilities
   - Multiple entry/exit points
   - High-risk, high-reward loot areas
   - Emergency escape routes

### Environmental Features

1. **Terrain Variety**

   - Open fields with scattered rocks
   - Dense forest areas
   - Marsh lands with reduced movement speed
   - Desert zone with sand dunes

2. **Dynamic Elements**
   - Destructible bridges
   - Movable cargo containers
   - Operational gates and doors
   - Interactive environmental hazards

### Map Flow and Balance

1. **Travel Routes**

   - Main roads connecting major POIs
   - Secret underground passages
   - Zip line network between elevated points
   - River system for water-based travel

2. **Strategic Chokepoints**

   - Bridge crossings
   - Mountain passes
   - Tunnel entrances
   - Valley pathways

3. **Safe Zone Considerations**
   - Multiple viable paths to circle center
   - Balanced cover distribution
   - Mixed elevation final circles
   - Alternative escape routes

## Objectives

- Design balanced first map with varied terrain
- Add strategic cover and points of interest (POIs)
- Implement performance-optimized level design
- Create clear visual landmarks for player orientation
- Add basic environmental hazards
- Ensure map consistency and security across all clients

## File Formats and Tools

1. **Blender Export Settings**

   ```json
   {
     "format": "glTF 2.0",
     "settings": {
       "compression": "draco",
       "exportCollisions": true,
       "textureFormat": "ktx2",
       "lodLevels": [100, 50, 25, 10],
       "chunkSize": 64,
       "scale": 1.0,
       "yUp": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Asset Organization**
   ```
   assets/
   ├── terrain/
   │   ├── chunks/
   │   ├── textures/
   │   └── collision/
   ├── props/
   │   ├── static/
   │   └── dynamic/
   ├── effects/
   └── metadata/
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Map contains varied terrain that creates interesting gameplay scenarios
- [ ] Strategic cover points are placed throughout the map
- [ ] 5-8 distinct points of interest are implemented
- [ ] Clear visual landmarks help with player orientation
- [ ] Environmental hazards are implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Map maintains 60+ FPS on target hardware
- [ ] Map assets are optimized for performance
- [ ] Map data is securely stored and distributed
- [ ] Client-side map verification is implemented
- [ ] Anti-cheat systems detect map manipulation attempts
- [ ] Map remains consistent across all clients
- [ ] Blender source files are properly organized and optimized
- [ ] Export pipeline successfully generates all required assets
- [ ] Map chunks load efficiently in Three.js
- [ ] LOD transitions are smooth and performant

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Basic rendering system
- Physics/collision system
