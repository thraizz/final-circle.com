# Initial Battle Royale Map Design

## Description

Design and implement the first battle royale map with balanced terrain, strategic cover points, and clear landmarks while maintaining optimal performance.

## Objectives

- Design balanced first map with varied terrain
- Add strategic cover and points of interest (POIs)
- Implement performance-optimized level design
- Create clear visual landmarks for player orientation
- Add basic environmental hazards

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Map Data Structure**

   - Create efficient spatial data structure for map representation
   - Implement collision system for terrain and objects
   - Add static object placement system
   - Create configuration for spawn points and loot locations

2. **Server-side Map Management**

   - Implement map loading and initialization system
   - Create efficient spatial partitioning for player interaction
   - Add environmental hazard logic and timers
   - Implement server-side performance optimizations

3. **Resource Management**

   - Create system for map asset loading and unloading
   - Implement instancing for repeated objects
   - Add server-side occlusion and culling

4. **Map Configuration**
   - Create data-driven map configuration system
   - Implement environmental settings control
   - Add map feature toggles for testing

### Client

1. **Rendering Optimization**

   - Implement level-of-detail (LOD) system for distant objects
   - Create efficient texture streaming system
   - Add frustum culling and occlusion culling
   - Implement instanced rendering for vegetation and debris

2. **Visual Design**

   - Create distinct visual themes for different map areas
   - Implement clear landmark visuals
   - Add subtle path indicators and navigation hints
   - Create performance-friendly lighting system

3. **Environment Effects**

   - Implement minimal but effective weather/atmosphere
   - Add subtle environmental animations
   - Create performance-optimized particle effects
   - Implement danger zone indicators

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Create benchmarking system for map performance
   - Implement analytics for identifying performance bottlenecks
   - Add tools for measuring FPS impact of different map elements
   - Create performance profiles for different hardware targets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Map contains varied terrain that creates interesting gameplay scenarios
- [ ] Strategic cover points are placed throughout the map
- [ ] 5-8 distinct points of interest are implemented
- [ ] Clear visual landmarks help with player orientation
- [ ] Environmental hazards are implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Map maintains 60+ FPS on target hardware
- [ ] Map assets are optimized for performance

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies
