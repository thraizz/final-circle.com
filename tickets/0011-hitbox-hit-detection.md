# Hitbox-Based Hit Detection Implementation

## Description

Implement a precise hitbox-based hit detection system to ensure accurate and skill-based combat with proper damage calculation based on hit location.

## Objectives

- Create hitbox-based hit detection for all player models
- Implement damage multipliers based on hit locations
- Add server-side validation for hit detection
- Create visual feedback for hit registration
- Implement lag compensation for hit detection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hit detection accurately registers hits on correct body parts
- [ ] Damage is properly calculated based on hit location
- [ ] Server validation prevents cheating in hit detection
- [ ] Hit feedback provides clear information about successful hits
- [ ] System works reliably even with moderate network latency
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal even with many players
- [ ] Hit detection feels responsive and accurate to players

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Player model implementation
- Combat system
- Lag compensation system
