# Hitbox-Based Hit Detection Implementation

## Description

Implement a precise hitbox-based hit detection system to ensure accurate and skill-based combat with proper damage calculation based on hit location.

## Objectives

- Create hitbox-based hit detection for all player models
- Implement damage multipliers based on hit locations
- Add server-side validation for hit detection
- Create visual feedback for hit registration
- Implement lag compensation for hit detection

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Hitbox System**

   - Design hierarchical hitbox structure (head, torso, limbs)
   - Implement efficient hitbox collision detection
   - Create damage calculation based on hit location
   - Add penetration detection for multiple hitboxes
   - Implement hitbox synchronization with animations

2. **Server Validation**

   - Create server-side hit validation using ray casting
   - Implement lag compensation for historical hit detection
   - Add anti-cheat measures for hit validation
   - Create detailed hit logs for analysis
   - Implement performance optimizations for hit checks

3. **Combat Logic**
   - Create damage application system
   - Implement hit registration events
   - Add kill feed and elimination attribution
   - Create headshot detection and special handling

### Client

1. **Hit Feedback**

   - Implement hit markers with location indication
   - Create hitbox visualization for debug mode
   - Add hit sound effects based on location
   - Implement minimal blood effects for hit confirmation
   - Create damage number indicators (optional)

2. **Client Prediction**
   - Implement client-side hit prediction
   - Create reconciliation for server corrections
   - Add visual anticipation for likely hits
   - Implement recoil integration with hit detection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hit detection accurately registers hits on correct body parts
- [ ] Damage is properly calculated based on hit location
- [ ] Server validation prevents cheating in hit detection
- [ ] Hit feedback provides clear information about successful hits
- [ ] System works reliably even with moderate network latency
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal even with many players
- [ ] Hit detection feels responsive and accurate to players

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Player model implementation
- Combat system
- Lag compensation system
