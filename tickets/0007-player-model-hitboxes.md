# Player Model and Hitbox Implementation

## Description

Implement player character model with proper hitboxes for precise hit detection, ensuring skill-based combat mechanics.

## Objectives

- Create optimized player character model
- Implement accurate hitboxes for different body parts
- Add damage multipliers for different hitbox regions
- Implement proper collision detection for player models
- Create smooth animations that maintain hitbox accuracy

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Hitbox System**

   - Design hitbox data structure for player model
   - Implement hierarchical hitbox system (head, torso, limbs)
   - Create damage multiplier system based on hit location
   - Add server-side hit validation using hitboxes
   - Implement hitbox synchronization with animation states

2. **Player Collision**
   - Create player collision capsule for movement
   - Implement proper player-to-player collision
   - Add player-to-world collision handling
   - Create optimization for collision checks

### Client

1. **Player Model**

   - Design performance-focused player model
   - Implement model LOD system for distance optimization
   - Create basic animation set (idle, run, jump, shoot)
   - Add first-person viewmodel
   - Implement third-person model

2. **Visual Feedback**

   - Add hit indicators based on hitbox location
   - Implement minimal blood effects for hits
   - Create hit reaction animations
   - Add damage indicators

3. **Animation System**
   - Implement animation state machine
   - Create smooth animation transitions
   - Add network-synchronized animations
   - Implement animation blending for natural movement

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Player model is visually clear and performs well
- [ ] Hitboxes accurately represent the player model
- [ ] Different body parts register correct damage multipliers
- [ ] Player collision works correctly with world and other players
- [ ] Animations are smooth and maintain hitbox accuracy
- [ ] Hit detection is precise and feels responsive
- [ ] First-person and third-person models are properly synchronized

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Basic movement implementation
- Combat system
- Animation system
