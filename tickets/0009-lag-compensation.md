# Lag Compensation System Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive lag compensation system to ensure fair and responsive gameplay despite varying network conditions, creating a consistent experience for all players.

## Objectives

- Create server-side player position history system
- Implement time-rewinding hit detection
- Add client-side prediction for responsive feedback
- Create server reconciliation for corrections
- Implement jitter buffer for unstable connections

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Player History System**

   - Implement efficient storage of historical player positions
   - Create configurable history buffer length
   - Add timestamp-based position recording
   - Implement memory-efficient storage optimization
   - Create pruning system for outdated history

2. **Time Rewind Logic**

   - Implement physics rewinding for hit detection
   - Create lag compensation algorithm based on client latency
   - Add configurable maximum compensation time
   - Implement hit validation using historical positions
   - Create anti-cheat measures for rewind exploitation

3. **Server Authority**
   - Implement server-authoritative movement with compensation
   - Create correction broadcast system
   - Add gradual correction for minor discrepancies
   - Implement immediate correction for major errors
   - Create compensation statistics for monitoring

### Client

1. **Client Prediction**

   - Implement local prediction for player actions
   - Create input buffer for consistent prediction
   - Add movement prediction based on physics
   - Implement shot prediction and visual feedback
   - Create reconciliation for server corrections

2. **Correction Handling**

   - Implement smooth visual correction for position updates
   - Create animation blending during corrections
   - Add subtle visual effects to mask corrections
   - Implement adaptive correction based on magnitude
   - Create jitter buffer for position updates

3. **Feedback Systems**
   - Implement network quality indicator
   - Create adaptive compensation based on connection quality
   - Add connection statistics display
   - Implement lag spike visualization
   - Create ping display

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Players with 50-150ms ping experience responsive gameplay
- [ ] Hit registration feels accurate despite latency
- [ ] Position corrections are visually smooth and non-disruptive
- [ ] System prevents exploitation by artificially high latency
- [ ] Server performance remains stable with many compensated players
- [ ] Players receive clear feedback about connection quality
- [ ] System gracefully handles extreme network conditions

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Network communication system
- Player movement implementation
- Combat system
