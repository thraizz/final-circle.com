# Lag Compensation System Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive lag compensation system to ensure fair and responsive gameplay despite varying network conditions, creating a consistent experience for all players.

## Objectives

- Create server-side player position history system
- Implement time-rewinding hit detection
- Add client-side prediction for responsive feedback
- Create server reconciliation for corrections
- Implement jitter buffer for unstable connections

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Players with 50-150ms ping experience responsive gameplay
- [ ] Hit registration feels accurate despite latency
- [ ] Position corrections are visually smooth and non-disruptive
- [ ] System prevents exploitation by artificially high latency
- [ ] Server performance remains stable with many compensated players
- [ ] Players receive clear feedback about connection quality
- [ ] System gracefully handles extreme network conditions

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Network communication system
- Player movement implementation
- Combat system
