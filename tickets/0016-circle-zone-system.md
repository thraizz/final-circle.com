# Circle/Zone System Implementation

## Description

Implement the core battle royale shrinking circle/zone mechanic that forces players to move toward a continuously smaller play area.

## Objectives

- Implement basic shrinking circle/zone mechanic
- Add damage system for players outside the safe zone
- Create simple visual indicators for zone boundaries
- Implement timers for zone shrinking
- Create final circle mechanics for endgame intensity

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Zone Configuration System**

   - Create data structures for zone parameters (radius, center point, shrink rate)
   - Implement zone generation algorithm with configurable parameters
   - Add zone state tracking for current and next zone positions

2. **Zone Timing System**

   - Implement timer system for zone phases (stable, shrinking, paused)
   - Create efficient broadcast mechanism for zone state updates
   - Add configuration options for timing parameters

3. **Damage System**

   - Implement spatial check for players outside safe zone
   - Create damage calculation based on zone phase and distance
   - Add efficient player health reduction system
   - Implement elimination attribution for zone deaths

4. **Final Circle Logic**
   - Create special rules for final zone size and behavior
   - Add increased damage for final circles
   - Implement endgame intensity mechanics

### Client

1. **Zone Visualization**

   - Implement efficient shader for zone boundary rendering
   - Create visual effects for zone edge (transparent wall, particles)
   - Add color coding for current/next zone states
   - Implement distance indicator for players outside zone

2. **UI Elements**

   - Create zone timer display
   - Implement zone phase indicators
   - Add directional indicators toward safe zone when outside
   - Create visual warning system for zone damage

3. **Audio Feedback**

   - Add audio cues for zone movement
   - Implement warning sounds for zone proximity
   - Create damage feedback audio

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize zone rendering for minimal performance impact
   - Implement efficient client-side zone prediction
   - Create level-of-detail system for zone effects based on distance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Zone shrinks at appropriate intervals with proper timing
- [ ] Players take damage when outside the safe zone at the correct rate
- [ ] Zone boundaries are clearly visible to players
- [ ] Zone timers are accurately displayed and function correctly
- [ ] Final circle creates balanced endgame scenarios
- [ ] Zone system is performant and doesn't cause lag or stuttering

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Map design completion
- Basic game state management
