# Movement Interpolation for Network Play

## Description

Implement smooth movement interpolation to ensure fluid player movement during network play, handling latency and packet loss elegantly.

## Objectives

- Implement client-side prediction for player movement
- Add server reconciliation for authoritative positioning
- Create smooth interpolation between network updates
- Implement jitter buffer for network inconsistency
- Add position correction that minimizes visual disruption

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Server Authority**

   - Implement authoritative movement validation
   - Create player position broadcasting system
   - Add position correction commands
   - Implement server-side movement history
   - Create timestamp-based movement snapshots

2. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement position compression for bandwidth efficiency
   - Add delta encoding for position updates
   - Create priority-based update system for nearby players
   - Implement update frequency adjustment based on distance

### Client

1. **Client-Side Prediction**

   - Create predictive movement based on input
   - Implement input buffering for consistent prediction
   - Add server reconciliation for corrections
   - Create smooth error correction without jarring visuals
   - Implement correction blending over time

2. **Interpolation System**

   - Create position interpolation between server updates
   - Implement rotation smoothing for natural movement
   - Add velocity-aware interpolation for better prediction
   - Create animation blending with interpolated movement

3. **Visual Smoothness**
   - Implement camera smoothing during corrections
   - Add visual effects to mask network corrections
   - Create adaptive interpolation based on network conditions
   - Implement jitter buffer for unstable connections

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Player movement appears smooth even with 100+ ms latency
- [ ] Position corrections are applied without jarring visual effects
- [ ] Server maintains authority over final positions
- [ ] Client prediction accurately estimates movement in most cases
- [ ] Network irregularities (jitter, packet loss) are handled gracefully
- [ ] System performs well with many players in close proximity
- [ ] Bandwidth usage is optimized for movement updates

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Basic movement implementation
- Network communication system
- Player model implementation
