# Movement Interpolation for Network Play

## Description

Implement smooth movement interpolation to ensure fluid player movement during network play, handling latency and packet loss elegantly.

## Objectives

- Implement client-side prediction for player movement
- Add server reconciliation for authoritative positioning
- Create smooth interpolation between network updates
- Implement jitter buffer for network inconsistency
- Add position correction that minimizes visual disruption

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Player movement appears smooth even with 100+ ms latency
- [ ] Position corrections are applied without jarring visual effects
- [ ] Server maintains authority over final positions
- [ ] Client prediction accurately estimates movement in most cases
- [ ] Network irregularities (jitter, packet loss) are handled gracefully
- [ ] System performs well with many players in close proximity
- [ ] Bandwidth usage is optimized for movement updates

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Basic movement implementation
- Network communication system
- Player model implementation
