# Combat Validation System Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive server-side combat validation system to ensure fair play, prevent cheating, and maintain competitive integrity while validating all aspects of combat mechanics.

## Objectives

- Create server-side validation for all combat actions
- Implement shot validation including line-of-sight checks
- Add rate-of-fire validation for weapons
- Create damage validation against possible exploits
- Implement anti-cheat measures for combat systems

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server correctly validates all shot trajectories
- [ ] Rate-of-fire exploits are prevented
- [ ] Damage values are consistently enforced
- [ ] Line-of-sight requirements are properly validated
- [ ] System handles high-latency scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Combat feels responsive despite server validation
- [ ] Cheating attempts are consistently detected and prevented

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Combat system implementation
- Lag compensation system
- Server-side game state management
