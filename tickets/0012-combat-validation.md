# Combat Validation System Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive server-side combat validation system to ensure fair play, prevent cheating, and maintain competitive integrity while validating all aspects of combat mechanics.

## Objectives

- Create server-side validation for all combat actions
- Implement shot validation including line-of-sight checks
- Add rate-of-fire validation for weapons
- Create damage validation against possible exploits
- Implement anti-cheat measures for combat systems

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Shot Validation**

   - Implement ray casting for line-of-sight validation
   - Create trajectory validation for projectiles
   - Add physics-based hit validation
   - Implement historical position checking for lag compensation
   - Create recoil pattern validation

2. **Rate Limiting**

   - Implement weapon-specific rate-of-fire checks
   - Create action sequence validation
   - Add cooldown enforcement for abilities
   - Implement burst fire validation
   - Create logging for suspicious fire rate patterns

3. **Damage Validation**

   - Create server-authoritative damage calculation
   - Implement hit location verification
   - Add damage cap validation
   - Create cheat detection for impossible damage patterns
   - Implement weapon damage profile enforcement

4. **Anti-Cheat Integration**
   - Create statistical analysis for combat patterns
   - Implement automated flagging for suspicious behavior
   - Add replay recording for suspicious combat sequences
   - Create admin review tools for combat validation
   - Implement progressive sanctions for detected cheating

### Client

1. **Feedback Systems**
   - Implement appropriate client feedback for rejected actions
   - Create subtle reconciliation for validation mismatches
   - Add ping-aware prediction for better gameplay feel
   - Implement clear feedback for connection issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server correctly validates all shot trajectories
- [ ] Rate-of-fire exploits are prevented
- [ ] Damage values are consistently enforced
- [ ] Line-of-sight requirements are properly validated
- [ ] System handles high-latency scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Combat feels responsive despite server validation
- [ ] Cheating attempts are consistently detected and prevented

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Combat system implementation
- Lag compensation system
- Server-side game state management
