# Minimal Health and Ammo UI Implementation

## Description

Implement a clean, minimal UI for displaying crucial player information (health and ammo) that provides clear feedback without cluttering the screen or impacting performance.

## Objectives

- Create minimal, performance-focused health display
- Implement ammo counter with magazine and reserve indicators
- Add subtle visual feedback for health changes
- Create weapon selection indicator
- Implement performance-optimized UI rendering

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Client

1. **Health Display**

   - Implement minimalist health bar or numeric indicator
   - Create subtle animations for health changes
   - Add critical health warning indicators
   - Implement color coding for health status
   - Create shader-based glow effects for critical status

2. **Ammo System**

   - Implement magazine and reserve ammo display
   - Create reload indicator and animation
   - Add weapon type indicator
   - Implement low ammo warning system
   - Create weapon switching visualization

3. **UI Framework**

   - Implement performance-optimized UI rendering system
   - Create UI component architecture
   - Add responsive positioning for different resolutions
   - Implement UI scale options
   - Create UI theme configuration

4. **Visual Feedback**

   - Implement subtle damage indicators at screen edges
   - Create hit direction visualization
   - Add healing/buff visual effects
   - Implement kill confirmation indicators
   - Create critical event notifications

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement UI culling and batching
   - Create efficient text rendering
   - Add UI caching for static elements
   - Implement adaptive UI complexity based on performance
   - Create UI performance monitoring
