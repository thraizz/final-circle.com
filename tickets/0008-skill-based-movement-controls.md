# Skill-Based Movement Controls Implementation

## Description

Implement acceleration, deceleration, and momentum physics for player movement to create a skill-based control system that rewards mastery.

## Objectives

- Add movement acceleration and deceleration physics
- Implement momentum-based movement mechanics
- Create air control mechanics for skilled jumping
- Add subtle movement techniques that reward skill
- Implement movement sound based on speed and surface

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Movement Physics**

   - Implement acceleration curves for different movement states
   - Create deceleration physics with friction variables
   - Add momentum conservation for jumps and falls
   - Implement surface-specific movement modifiers
   - Create server validation for movement physics

2. **Skill Mechanics**
   - Implement variable jump height based on button hold time
   - Create subtle movement techniques (b-hopping, air strafing)
   - Add momentum-based fall damage
   - Implement speed caps with grace periods

### Client

1. **Control System**

   - Create responsive input handling with variable sensitivity
   - Implement input buffering for smoother transitions
   - Add visual feedback for movement states
   - Create speed indicators for player awareness

2. **Animation Integration**

   - Implement animation blending based on movement speed
   - Create transition animations for acceleration/deceleration
   - Add leaning animations for direction changes
   - Implement footstep system tied to movement speed

3. **Audio Feedback**
   - Create velocity-based movement sound system
   - Implement surface-specific footstep sounds
   - Add audio cues for movement states (landing, jumping)
   - Create subtle audio feedback for skilled movement

## Acceptance Criteria
