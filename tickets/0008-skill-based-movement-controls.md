# Skill-Based Movement Controls Implementation

## Description

Implement acceleration, deceleration, and momentum physics for player movement to create a skill-based control system that rewards mastery.

## Objectives

- Add movement acceleration and deceleration physics
- Implement momentum-based movement mechanics
- Create air control mechanics for skilled jumping
- Add subtle movement techniques that reward skill
- Implement movement sound based on speed and surface

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Movement has natural feeling acceleration and deceleration
- [ ] Player momentum is properly conserved during jumps
- [ ] Skilled players can execute advanced movement techniques
- [ ] Movement sounds reflect player speed and surface type
- [ ] Animations smoothly blend based on movement state
- [ ] Controls feel responsive despite physics-based movement
- [ ] Movement system rewards skill without being inaccessible to new players

## Priority

Medium (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Basic movement implementation
- Physics system
- Animation system
