# Basic Audio System Implementation

## Description

Implement a foundational audio system for the battle royale game with positional audio for key gameplay elements to enhance immersion and provide critical gameplay feedback.

## Objectives

- Implement positional audio for footsteps and player movement
- Add weapon sound profiles with distance attenuation
- Create audio cues for zone mechanics and warnings
- Implement basic ambient and environmental sounds
- Ensure performance-optimized audio processing

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Audio Event Broadcasting**

   - Implement audio event generation for server-side actions
   - Create audio event categories and priorities
   - Add distance-based audio event filtering
   - Implement positional data for spatial audio events
   - Create audio event compression for network efficiency

2. **Sound Management**
   - Implement sound trigger points in game logic
   - Create zone-related sound event generation
   - Add player action sound event generation
   - Implement weapon-specific sound profiles
   - Create environmental sound event system

### Client

1. **Audio Engine**

   - Implement WebAudio API integration
   - Create 3D positional audio system
   - Add audio listener attached to player camera
   - Implement distance-based attenuation
   - Create audio occlusion system (basic version)
   - Add performance-focused audio pooling

2. **Sound Assets**

   - Implement sound asset loading and caching system
   - Create performance-optimized audio formats
   - Add footstep sounds for different surfaces
   - Implement weapon sound profiles (fire, reload, empty)
   - Create zone warning and damage sounds

3. **Audio Mixing**
   - Implement category-based volume control
   - Create dynamic mixing based on situation
   - Add audio prioritization system
   - Implement fade effects for smooth transitions
   - Create master volume and mute controls

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Footsteps and movement sounds provide directional information
- [ ] Weapon sounds are distinct and provide gameplay feedback
- [ ] Zone warnings are clear and help with situational awareness
- [ ] Audio performance remains optimized even with many sound sources
- [ ] Volume levels are properly balanced across different sound types
- [ ] Sound occlusion provides basic information about obstacles
- [ ] Overall audio experience enhances immersion without performance impact

## Priority

Medium (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Player movement system
- Weapon system
- Zone system
- Asset loading system
