# Battle Royale Drop System and Match Flow Implementation

## Description

Implement a complete battle royale airdrop system for initial player deployment and proper match flow from drop to victory.

## Objectives

- Implement aircraft path generation across the map
- Add player-controlled airdrop/parachute system
- Create match start sequence with pre-drop countdown
- Implement real-time player count indicator
- Add player elimination and placement tracking

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Backend

1. **Aircraft System**

   - Create aircraft path generation algorithm across the map
   - Implement aircraft speed and timing configuration
   - Add dropzone restriction management (if applicable)
   - Create player attachment to aircraft at match start
   - Implement synchronized aircraft movement for all players

2. **Drop Mechanics**

   - Implement player-initiated drop from aircraft
   - Create parachute/glide physics with player control
   - Add landing detection and ground interaction
   - Implement altitude-based speed control
   - Create early landing incentives and risks

3. **Match Flow Management**

   - Implement match state machine (lobby, aircraft, in-progress, ending)
   - Create player state tracking (alive, eliminated)
   - Add victory condition check that runs on player elimination events
   - Implement match result calculation and storage

4. **Player Count Tracking**

   - Add real-time player count to game state
   - Create efficient broadcast system for player count updates
   - Implement player disconnection handling for accurate counts
   - Add elimination feed and kill attribution
   - Create placement tracking system

### Client

1. **Drop Visualization**

   - Implement aircraft and player dropping animations
   - Create parachute deployment and control system
   - Add wind and physics effects for realistic falling
   - Implement first-person and third-person drop views
   - Create landing effects and transitions

2. **UI Elements**

   - Create drop altitude and speed indicators
   - Implement aircraft path visualization on map
   - Add player count display with elimination updates
   - Create elimination feed with kill information
   - Implement match flow UI elements (countdown, match state)

3. **Player Controls**

   - Implement directional controls during free-fall
   - Create parachute deployment controls with timing strategy
   - Add landing preparation controls
   - Implement camera controls during descent
   - Create smooth transition from landing to ground movement

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Aircraft path generates randomly across the map for each match
- [ ] Players can choose when to drop and control their descent
- [ ] Parachute deployment and control feels responsive and strategic
- [ ] Transition from air to ground is smooth and responsive
- [ ] Last player/team standing is correctly identified as the winner
- [ ] Player count and eliminations are accurately displayed in real-time
- [ ] Player placement is correctly tracked and displayed at match end

## Priority

High (required for MVP)

## Dependencies

- Map design completion
- Basic movement system
- Game state management
